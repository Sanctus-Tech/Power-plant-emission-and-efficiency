# Power Plant Emissions and Efficiency Analysis ⚡

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the environmental and operational efficiency of power plants across different U.S. states. Using data on generation capacity, emissions (CO₂, SO₂, NOx), and resource mixes, the goal is to identify which states are the most efficient, the biggest contributors to emissions, and how fuel type choices affect performance.

## Background

Power plants are critical for meeting electricity demand, but they are also one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Understanding the relationship between **generation efficiency** and **pollutant emissions** helps policymakers, regulators, and utility companies make data-driven decisions toward cleaner energy.

This analysis focuses on:

* Comparing state level generation and emissions.
* Identifying top and bottom states in efficiency.
* Understanding fuel dependency patterns (coal, gas, oil, biomass, etc.).
* Highlighting emission intensity per unit of generation (MWh).

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel** → For initial data preprocessing and organization.
* **Power BI** → For visualization, dashboards, and deriving insights.

## Analysis

The analysis covered the following key areas:

1. **Demographics vs Emissions**

   * Compared CO₂, SO₂, and NOx emissions across states.
   * Found Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania among the largest CO₂ emitters.

2. **Top Emitters by Pollutant**

   * Identified leading states for NOx, SO₂, and CO₂ emissions.
   * Example: Texas led in both NOx and SO₂ emissions, while Florida was a major CO₂ emitter.

3. **Fuel Mix by State**

   * Examined non-baseload generation across coal, oil, gas, biomass, and other fuels.
   * Showed varying dependency on different energy sources by states.

4. **Efficiency Ranking**

   * Ranked states by average generator capacity factor and net generation.
   * Highlighted the **Top 10 most efficient states** and **Bottom 10 least efficient states**.

5. **Emission Intensity**

   * Measured emissions per MWh (CO₂, SO₂, NOx).
   * Identified which states generate cleaner power relative to their output.

## What I Learned

* Different states rely heavily on different fuel types, directly impacting emissions.
* High generation capacity does not always mean high efficiency capacity factor plays a critical role.
* Texas dominates in multiple emission categories, showing both high output and high pollution.
* Renewable heavy states tend to have lower emissions per MWh, proving cleaner efficiency.
* Combining Excel preprocessing with Power BI visualization provides a powerful workflow for energy analysis.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the trade offs between power generation, fuel mix, and environmental impact. While some states achieve high efficiency, they also face challenges with high emissions. On the other hand, states shifting toward renewables show lower emission intensity, pointing toward sustainable energy practices.

The insights from this analysis can guide **energy policy, environmental regulation, and investment in renewable energy infrastructure.**
